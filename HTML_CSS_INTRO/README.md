## Introduction

- This directory serves as a repository for HTML and CSS files used in web development projects.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style sheets) is used to style and format the content of HTML documents.

- Whether you're creating a simple webpage, building a responsive website, or designing a complex web application, understanding HTML and CSS is essential for front-end development.

## File Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

1. index.html: The main HTML file serving as the entry point for the website or web application.
2. style.css: The main CSS file containing styles for the HTML elements defined in the HTML files.
3. assets/: A directory containing additional assets such as images, fonts, or other resources used in the web pages.

Feel free to create additional HTML and CSS files as needed for your projects. You can organize them into subdirectories based on project requirements or categories.
